# TNSR Postman Collections

This public repo contains a POSTMAN enviroment and postman collection that can be used to interact with TNSR. TNSR is a high-performance software router based on FD.io's Verctor Packet Processing (VPP). TNSR software combines VPP with Data Plane Developement Kit (DPDK) and other open-source technologies to provide a high-performace router which enables businesses and service providers to address today's edge and cloud networking needs.

You can edit the variables in the enviroment to point to your own TNSR device. Feel free to modify them as you see fit and add more calls to the collection.
